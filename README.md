# TTT-DLBootcamp
# DL_bootcamp

This bootcamp aims to provide participants with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed to develop deep learning solutions in the field of computer vision. In this repository, you will find educational materials, coding examples and exercises to get started in this field. 

After completing the bootcamp, all participants will be familiar with the following key concepts and possess the ability to apply them to a problem:

-  PyTorch basics & fundamentals: Dealing with tensor operations
-  Data pre-processing for computer vision tasks
-  Building a PyTorch model from scratch
-  Fitting the model to data (training)
-  Customizing a pretrained model through transfer learning
-  Making predictions and visualizing the outputs of the model (inference)
-  Evaluating model performance
